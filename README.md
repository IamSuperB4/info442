## Problem Statement

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is one of the world's worst pandemics. While much about this virus is unknown, it is continuing to spread rapidly. The widespread outbreak has forced many countries to employ mass quarantines and international travel bans. In particular, social distancing has been used as a common means to slow the transmission. As a result, many individuals have been stuck at home unable to explore their cities. In particular, as students return to campus they are unsure of the activities and businesses that exist in their proximity.  Additionally, social distancing has not only affected our mental and physical health, but has also caused a global economic strain - specifically towards small-medium enterprises (SME). In the United States during the first three months of the pandemic, the number of active business owners dropped by 3.3 million or over 22%. This was the largest ever drop recorded, and its impact was felt across almost all industries. African-American businesses experience the harshest drop with 41% drop in business activity, while Latinx dropped by 32%, and Asian businesses dropped by 26%. (Fairlie, 2020). At restaurants, social distancing means little to no tables therefore we are not able to socialize.
